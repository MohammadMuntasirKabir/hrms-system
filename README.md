## Features

### Multi-Company Support

- Company-level data filtering across all modules

### Role-Based Access Control (6 roles, 32+ permissions)

| **Super Admin** | Full access across all companies. Only one at a time. |
| **Company Admin** | Full access within own company tree. One per company. |
| **HR Manager** | Employees, contracts, applicants, payroll |
| **HR Executive** | View-only + limited create/edit |
| **Department Head** | Department employees, leave approval |
| **Employee** | Own profile and leave only |

### Modules

- **Companies** — CRUD with hierarchy, user/department/contract counts
- **Departments** — CRUD with parent-child nesting, head assignment
- **Designations** — Job titles with level hierarchy
- **Employees (Users)** — Full CRUD with role assignment
- **Contracts** — Full CRUD with type, expiry tracking, salary
- **Salaries** — Full CRUD with base/allowances/deductions/net calculation
- **Job Applicants** — Full recruitment pipeline (Pending → Reviewing → Shortlisted → Hired/Rejected)
- **Audit Logging** — Company & Department CRUD operations logged via Observers
- **API Resources** — CompanyResource and DepartmentResource for API responses

## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:MohammadMuntasirKabir/hrms-system.git
cd HRMS/HRM-System   # (or: cd hrms-system if cloned as the repo root)
composer install
npm install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate --seed
npm run build
# Or for development:
composer run dev
```

## Deploying to Vercel

This project is deployed to Vercel using the PHP runtime (`vercel-php@0.9.0`). The
`vercel.json` at the repo root routes all requests through a serverless PHP function
(`api/index.php`) and serves the built `public/` directory. The GitHub repo
(`MohammadMuntasirKabir/hrms-system`) is connected to the Vercel project, so
**pushing to `main` triggers a server-side production build automatically** — no local
CLI upload needed.

```bash
# One-time: link the project locally (optional; Git connection handles deploys)
vercel link

# Deploy: just push to main
git push origin main        # Vercel builds & promotes automatically

# Or force a manual CLI build (slower — re-uploads the project)
vercel --prod
```

> Note: `.vercelignore` excludes `vendor/`, `node_modules/`, and `.git/` from
> uploads — Vercel runs `composer install && npm run build` itself during the build
> step (see `buildCommand` in `vercel.json`).

Environment variables required on Vercel: `APP_KEY`, `DB_CONNECTION`, `DB_DATABASE`
(or your MySQL/PostgreSQL credentials), and any mail/cache config used in production.

## Default Login

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Email | `admin@hrms.local` |
| Password | `password` |

## Running Tests

```bash
php artisan test                    # All tests
php artisan test --compact          # Compact output
php artisan test --filter="CompanyTest"  # Specific test
```

**209+ tests** covering all CRUD operations, authorization, role-based access, applicant workflow, audit logging, and dashboard per role.
